RiskAnalysis

This is a project to predict the risk factor( i.e. the probability of a person having a heart disease) by analysing the vitals of the person.
We are using The Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease
The use case is in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where there is a lack of specialised cardiologists. The model can be used to predict the risk factor of a person by performing simpler tests like based on Blood Pressure, Cholestrol level etc. which are easily available at rural medical setups as well.
